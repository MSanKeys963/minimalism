Hi everyone! My name is Sanket Verma and I hail from New Delhi, India. I‚Äôm excited to publish my first blog post. This post is more of an initiation post rather than a regular post. In the upcoming days, I‚Äôd be writing about technology, computer science, data science, open-source software and communities, movies, sports and games not necessarily in that order!</div>

Writing a blog has been on my mind for quite some time but I didn‚Äôt have enough time until now. I‚Äôll try to be as regular as I can be.

I‚Äôve dabbled with many interesting things in my life as of now. Just a glimpse of my past looks something like this:

- Worked as Research & Development Engineer @ Ballistics, Forensic Science Lab
- Worked as Research Data Science Intern @ Dunnhumby
- Worked as Product Development Intern @ Gramener
- Community Lead @ PyData Delhi
- Executive Chair @ PyData Delhi 2017, 2018 & 2019 & PyData Global 2020 & 2021
- Zonal Football Player
- The Reader of Sci-Fi, Fiction, Cosmology and Fantasy Books
- Watcher of Thriller, Horror, Sci-Fi and Fantasy Movies and T.V. Shows
- Mountain Trekker @ Himalayas
- Avid Runner

and much more!

I hope this will give you a brief idea about what I like to do and where do I go when I‚Äôm free!

You‚Äôll be hearing from me soon. Until then, Adios! ‚úåüèª
